## üîπ Footnotes & Methodology

### **Methodology**

- **Gemini results:** All Gemini 2.5 Pro scores are pass@1 (no majority voting or parallel test time compute unless indicated otherwise). They are all run with the AI Studio API for the model-id `gemini-2.5-pro-exp-03-25` with default sampling settings. To reduce variance, we average over multiple trials for smaller benchmarks. Vibe-Eval results are reported using Gemini as a judge.

- **Non-Gemini results:** All the results for non-Gemini models are sourced from providers' self-reported numbers. All SWE-bench Verified numbers follow official provider reports, using different scaffolding and infrastructure. Google‚Äôs scaffolding includes drawing multiple trajectories and re-scoring them using model‚Äôs own judgement.

- **Thinking vs non-thinking:** For Claude 3.7 Sonnet: GPQA, AIME 2024, MMMU come with 64k extended thinking; Aider with 32k; and HLE with 16k. Remaining results come from the non-thinking model due to result availability. For Grok-3 all results come with extended reasoning except for SimpleQA (based on xAI reports).

- **Single attempt vs multiple attempts:** When two numbers are reported for the same evaluation, higher number uses majority voting with n=64 for Grok models and internal scoring with parallel test time compute for Anthropic models.

- **Result sources:**

  - Aider Polyglot: [aider.chat/docs/leaderboards](https://aider.chat/docs/leaderboards)
  - MRCR includes 128k results as a cumulative score and 1M pointwise values to show full-length model capability.

### **Symbol Key**

- `*` indicates evaluation on **text problems only** (no images)
- ‚Äúdiff‚Äù = performance difference from base output after edits (for Aider Polyglot)
- ‚Äúpass@1‚Äù = first-attempt success rate (no majority vote)

## üîπ Footnotes

1. **Llama model results** are 0 shot with temperature = 0 and no majority voting or parallel test time compute. For high-variance benchmarks (GPQA Diamond, LiveCodeBench), results are averaged over multiple generations to reduce uncertainty.

2. For **non-Llama models**, highest available self-reported eval results are shown, unless otherwise noted. Evals must come from reproducible models (via API/open weights), and are only from non-thinking modes.

3. **Cost estimates** for non-Llama models are from Artificial Analysis.

4. **DeepSeek v3.1‚Äôs** range is unknown (49.2), so internal result (45.8) is used on defined data range. GPT-4o results are from LCB leaderboard.

5. **Specialized long context evals** are not typically reported for generalist models, so internal runs are used to show Llama's frontier performance.

6. **$0.19/1Mtok (3:1 blended)** is the cost estimate for Llama 4 Maverick using distributed inference. On a single host, cost is projected at $0.30‚Äì$0.49/1Mtok.
